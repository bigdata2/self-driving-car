### Dependencies
I have built and tested this model on Linux (Ubuntu 16.04). The model has the following dependencies:
- Udacity's simulator which can be found [here](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/February/58983558_beta-simulator-linux/beta-simulator-linux.zip)
- The model requires a few libraries all of which can be easily setup using miniconda, instructions [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md)
- Nvidia GPU (optional) 


### How to run the model
- Clone the repo
- Download simulator from the above link
- Open simulator by executing ./linux_sim.x86_64
- Execute the model using the following command: python drive.py  model.json
